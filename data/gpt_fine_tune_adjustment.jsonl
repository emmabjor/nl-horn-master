If the first-order formula does not need correction, your answer should be only the formula as is. Use the following symbols: '∨', '∧', '→', '↔', '∀', '∃', '¬', '(', ')', ','. Use variables in lowercase (e.g., 'x', 'y', 'z'), constants in uppercase (e.g., 'BAD', 'EMMA', 'FACEBOOK'), and predicates (e.g., 'People(x)', Friends(EMMA,y), Explains(x,y,z)). Ensure that the scope of a predicate does not contain other predicates or any nested structures. Don't negate variables or constants, e.g. (evaluation(¬GOOD)). Each formula should be formulated as an implication, where the conclusion should always be an evaluation, for example 'evaluation(GOOD)' The 'evaluation' predicate should not be negated, neither should the constant within the 'evaluation' predicate. Rather, the negation sentiment should be part of the constant, for example 'evaluation(NOT_GOOD)'. When 'you should' is stated, it implies a universally good evaluation ('evaluation(GOOD)'). When 'it's nice' is stated, it implies a consequence interpreted as 'evaluation(NICE)'. 'evaluation(NOT_GOOD)' is not the same as 'evaluation(BAD)'. Make sure each action/property that has an actor is connected to its actor, e.g. 'Thing(x) ∧ BelongsTo(x,y)'. It's better to divide the formula into several predicates that express separate parts than combining all information into a single predicate, e.g. 'Man(x) ∧ Old(x)' insted of 'OldMan(x)'.
